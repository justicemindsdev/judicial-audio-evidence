I taught him how to be gentle when he was being too rough. I said, I told him what to cook his own little pizza. The teacher said, is he Spanish? Because the kids were saying he's able from a different country because I was teaching them Spanish. The pediatricians thanked me for sending footage of him because they'd never seen him. There was four appointments missed and he couldn't speak. He didn't know what his mannerisms were, what his body motions was, what his triggers were. So I filmed his interactions, showed the family it was all great. And that amazing step forward to Abel's needs got misconstrued and backfired. It wasn't naked. The Other vessel on and he was in his age appropriate attire for 2 seconds. 2 seconds. Because she said thinking about two seconds of the video and not the setting the child was in, which absolutely defeats the object of the purpose of reaching out for help. But that's what happens when local authorities don't respond to you. It is desperation. When you're in a crisis, you're doing whatever you can to do the best you can. We reached out to the local authority endless times. I'm talking like over 50 emails begging for help.",
